          <li>DOCTYPE html tells the browser to expect HTML</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element sits within the head tag and contains the browser tab title</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Three types of CSS: Inline CSS, Internall CSS, External CSS. External CSS is usually preferred in most cases, as it keeps CSS in its own separate document, whereas Inline CSS and Internal CSS has to be updated individually for every change</li>
          <li>Margin: indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>Padding: indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you make the whole element bigger</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) coding allows you to group selectors that use the same styling to save repeating it for each selector. This reduces the overall size and complexity of a codebase</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code. To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code. Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. For example: var shape = “circle”;. In this example, "shape" is the name of our container, or variable, and the data it stores is "circle".</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>If statement: code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
          <li>Else if statement: provides additional conditions.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Index numbers always start from 0 and go up in increments of 1.</li>
          <li>For loops use a predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Add /* before code and */ after code to comment out code without deleting it in case we need it later.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. To create a function, we use the function keyword. Then we give our function a unique name. A functions name is followed by parentheses (). Functions only run when they are called. To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute.</li>
